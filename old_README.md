# Highlights
A place to keep track of my highlights on github (papers, projects, etc.)

[Papers](https://github.com/maxrenke/papers)

A repo that holds papers I have authored.

[Twitch Viewer](https://github.com/maxrenke/twitch_viewer)

Python script to integrate with Livestreamer and VLC on windows. Allows you to see which streamers that you follow are live and open up their broadcasts in VLC.

[DeadmanPi](https://github.com/maxrenke/deadmanpi)
This project was submitted to the [HackDartmouth III](hackdartmouth.io) event held on September 24 - 25, 2016.

The goal of this project is to use a **Raspberry Pi 3** board along with **GrovePi** sensors to create a **Node.js** server that has a hard-ware **DEADMAN** switch. If certain physical triggers are detected by the **Raspberry Pi** then the sever will delete all of the files on the server. Originally, this project was meant to interface with the document sharing API at [IntraLinks](https://developers.intralinks.com) but this project still serves as a proof of concept of a server with a physical **DEADMAN** switch attached.

This project was built with **Raspberry Pi 3**, **GrovePi Board**, **GrovePi Sensors**, **Node.js**, **Python**, and **Swagger.io**.

**Node.js** powers the server as well as the RESTful API (which is powered by **Swagger.io**)

**Python** powers the **DEADMAN** switch.


[Politilt](https://github.com/maxrenke/politilt)

POLI TILT is a Chrome Web Extension that is powered by the Indico political analysis API to determine the bias of a political news article. Scores include Liberal (left leaning), Moderate (relatively neutral), and Conservative (right leaning). This helpful for those who are "politically inebriated" and want to make sure they are getting the correct perspective of the political landscape. POLI TILT also has a backend MySQL database to store the articles as well as our analysis.

This project was completed during HackDartmouth II (Spring 2015).

NOTE: Backend is no longer operational

[ComputeCoin](https://github.com/maxrenke/ComputeCoin)

The goal of this project is to create a centralized digital currency backed by distributed computation for nonprofit organizations. A peer to peer mobile application, centralized distribution network, desktop application and computation-specific API will be created to develop a working proof of concept.

This project was completed during HackDartmouth II (Fall 2014).


[Aviation](https://github.com/maxrenke/aviation)

An iOS application for Aviation Museum of New Hampshire in Manchester, NH. The project completed during at 4 day hackathon at Dyn.

[GPPC 2015](https://github.com/maxrenke/gppc-2015)

This repository contains my submission of Speedy and weighted A* algorithms to the GPPC in 2015
