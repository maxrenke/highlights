A place to keep track of my highlights on github (papers, projects, etc.)

[Twitch Viewer](https://github.com/maxrenke/twitch_viewer)

[ComputeCoin](https://github.com/maxrenke/ComputeCoin)

The goal of this project is to create a centralized digital currency backed by distributed computation for nonprofit organizations. A peer to peer mobile application, centralized distribution network, desktop application and computation-specific API will be created to develop a working proof of concept.

This project was completed during HackDartmouth II (Fall 2014).

[Politilt](https://github.com/maxrenke/politilt)

POLI TILT is a Chrome Web Extension that is powered by the Indico political analysis API to determine the bias of a political news article. Scores include Liberal (left leaning), Moderate (relatively neutral), and Conservative (right leaning). This helpful for those who are "politically inebriated" and want to make sure they are getting the correct perspective of the political landscape. POLI TILT also has a backend MySQL database to store the articles as well as our analysis.

This project was completed during HackDartmouth II (Spring 2015).

NOTE: Backend is no longer operational
